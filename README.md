# MakeChangeProject

# Description

This project is a simulation of a cash register, and the process in which it makes it's calculations. After the user opens the project in eclipse, user presses the "run" button to begin the program. The user will then be asked for the cost of an item they would like to "purchase", and then the amount of money which they are giving to the register. The program then does it's calculations to find out the change that is due back to the user. After, it breaks up the calculations into the most efficient use of the 8 different denominations of US currency, and displays the answer back in the console.

# Technologies Used

Java, Eclipse, Slack, Zoom, Terminal, Github

# Lessons Learned

I've learned lots over the course of this project. I learned that feeling overwhelmed at first does not correlate with the actual difficulty of the project. I learned that to deal with the overwhelmed feeling, it is a good idea to compartmentalize the project into different tasks that are needed to complete it, and then to complete those one by one. I learned during the week how to utilize methods, and this solidified that further. I learned how using different operations will change the value of a variable, and I learned how casting will affect the data.
